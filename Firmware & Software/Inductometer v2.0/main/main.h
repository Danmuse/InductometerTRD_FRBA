// WARNING: The total memory used for parity checking in addition to the regular SRAM usage is 2560 Bytes,
//          that is, 12.8% of the SRAM memory occupied for the STM32F103x family of microcontrollers.
//          The "printFromSD" function located in "processFunctions.h" occupies 76% of the SRAM memory at maximum performance.
//          The vector to represent the gradient line in the menu occupies located in "gradientMenu.h" occupies 2.4% of the SRAM memory.
//          So the required SRAM memory will occupy approximately 91.2%, without considering the global variables of the program.
